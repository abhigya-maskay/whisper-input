# Current Task: Step 10 â€“ Testing and QA

- [x] Review existing automated test suites (unit, integration, async) to ensure coverage for all orchestrator components.
- [x] Identify missing scenarios for recorder, transcriber, injector, and CLI layers; add targeted tests or fixtures where gaps exist.
- [x] Integrate the full test suite into `flake.nix` checks so `nix flake check` validates code health automatically.
- [x] Execute the test suite locally (pytest, async tests) and resolve any failures or flaky behavior.
- [x] Perform manual validation within a Hyprland session to confirm hold-to-record workflow, transcription accuracy, and failure handling.
- [x] Record findings from manual QA, noting issues, mitigations, or confirmations for future reference.
